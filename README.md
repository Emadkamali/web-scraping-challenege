# Introduction

This project is a deep dive into Mars-centric web scraping and data analysis, aiming to extract valuable insights from Mars-related content.

## Part 1

In the initial phase, I automated browsing techniques to navigate Mars news sites, extracting essential elements such as titles and preview texts from the HTML using Beautiful Soup. The extracted data was organized into Python dictionaries and presented in a clear format within the Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, an option for exporting the data to a JSON file was provided for easier sharing.

## Part 2

Moving on to Part 2, the focus shifted to Mars weather data analysis. Using automated browsing once again, I targeted Mars Temperature Data Site, identifying and scraping data from an HTML table. Rather than relying on Pandas' read_html function, I continued to refine my web scraping skills with Beautiful Soup.

After assembling the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame, thorough data cleaning was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved converting data types where necessary and addressing any inconsistencies or missing values. Utilizing Pandas functionalities, I conducted various analyses, including determining the number of months on Mars, identifying the coldest and warmest months, and analyzing atmospheric pressure trends.

Finally, the cleaned and analyzed DataFrame was exported to a CSV file for future reference and analysis.

Overall, this project serves as a testament to my proficiency in web scraping and data analysis, providing valuable insights into Mars news and weather data for further exploration and understanding.
